# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Adding bootstrap components to my portfolio site.

## Technologies used:
Visual Studio Code
Bootstrap starter template
Bootstrap navbar and cards

## Summary: The purpose of revisiting my site was to apply responsive elements to the page so forms would either collapse into vertical column read or horizontal read. This was achieved by understanding how the row and 12 column system works on Bootstrap. Bootstrap was a new technology introduced to me so I wanted the opportunity to also play around with components and see how they can boost the appearance of my site.

## Steps:

1. I started by pasting the Bootstrap starter template on my three working .html files.

2. I then took code that I could apply immediately to my page from my previous homework assignment, starting with HTML elements and relevant areas of CSS code that could work within Bootstrap's allowance (such as my footer).

3. I then re-did my navigation bar from standard CSS to Bootstrap's responsive nav bar. 

4. Applied background image using CSS.

5. I started with the index.html file as it was pretty straight-forward design element wise with rows and columns.

6. As I started my "Contact" page I began to run into areas with my pre-existing CSS, because once i tried to lower the width of the page the contact form wouldn't collapse, leaving an area to scroll to the write in order to view it. I spoke for an hour on the phone with my bootcamp tutor Ryan who was able to provide me with suggestions, such as reviewing if syntax correctly, making sure all divs were closed, and finding areas of my CSS that were clashing with the pre-defined CSS markup that Bootstrap contains. 

7. The "Portfolio" page was the biggest obstacle for me. Through Bootstrap documentation and help through a YouTube video tutorial I was able to understand how to position my rows and columns corerctly in order to get my five images positioned. The thing was, I wasn't able to change the padding "down-column" so to speak. so I scrapped this and went with the use of five Bootstrap cards instead, where it was easy to apply them within the row and column system that I had already set up. While the cards will collapse, I still need to find out how to position them properly, as Bootstrap CSS is an entirely different system of knowledge around the positioning and targeting your desired classes and IDs (which was furstrating at points!).

$$ <strong> With that in mind, I hope to hear feedback on how I can better control the elements on my page!</strong>
